### 4. The Shift: AI Assistants → AI Agents
The investment thesis has fundamentally shifted. We're no longer betting on AI assistants that help humans work—we're betting on AI agents that replace human workflows entirely.

**The distinction:**
| AI Assistants | AI Agents |
|---------------|-----------|
| Help you write | Write for you |
| Suggest analysis | Run analysis autonomously |
| Answer questions | Execute workflows |
| Human-in-the-loop | Human-out-of-the-loop |

## 💡 Key Insights

### 🔥 Vertical AI Unicorns Are Emerging

The horizontal model layer is saturated. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta have commoditized foundation models. The new opportunity is **vertical application layers**.

**Emerging vertical unicorns:**

| Company | Industry | Valuation | Latest Raise |
|---------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Runway | Video Production | $5.3B | $315M |
| Basis | Accounting | $1.15B | $100M |
| Freeform | Manufacturing | ~$250M* | $67M |

*Estimated based on funding round.

### 🎯 Why Vertical Wins

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Deeper moats** | Domain expertise + proprietary data |
| **Clearer revenue** | Displacing specific roles/workflows |
| **Thinner competition** | Horizontal players can't specialize fast enough |
| **Sticky customers** | Workflow integration creates lock-in |

### 📈 The Pattern

```
Horizontal AI (2022-2024):
"Build a better chatbot" → Saturated, commoditized

Vertical AI (2025-2026):
"Build an agent for [specific industry]" → New unicorns forming
```

## 👀 What to Watch

| Trend | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| **Vertical AI in healthcare** | Regulatory moats + massive TAM |
| **Legal AI agents** | Contract review, compliance automation |
| **Financial services agents** | Trading, risk analysis, compliance |
| **Manufacturing autonomy** | Freeform model scaling to other industries |
| **Vertical AI M&A** | Big Tech acquiring specialized agents |

---

## 📊 By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Basis valuation | **$1.15B** |
| Runway valuation | **$5.3B** |
| Freeform funding | **$67M** |
| US AI startups raising $100M+ in 2026 | **17 companies** (in 2 months) |

---

## 🚀 The Playbook

If you're building in AI:
1. **Don't compete with foundation models**
2. **Pick a specific industry vertical**
3. **Build agents, not assistants**
4. **Own the workflow end-to-end**

The next wave of AI unicorns won't be horizontal platforms. They'll be vertical agents that quietly run entire industries.
