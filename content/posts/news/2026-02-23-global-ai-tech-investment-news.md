## 💡 Key Insights

### 🔥 World Model Race Intensifies
Major AI labs—Runway, World Labs, Google DeepMind—are betting big on **World Models**: AI systems that internally represent environments and predict future outcomes. 

**Why this matters:** LLMs process language. World Models understand physical reality. This is the shift from "reading about the world" to "understanding the world." The implications for robotics, simulation, and physical AI are enormous.

### 🌏 India Emerges as Global AI Infrastructure Hub
India is rapidly becoming a new center for AI infrastructure investment. With Reliance and Adani's **$200 billion+** combined plans, a global race for AI sovereignty is intensifying. 

**The structural shift:** "Intelligence cannot be borrowed," as Ambani stated. Countries and companies are realizing that AI capability—compute, data, models—is becoming a matter of economic sovereignty. This is the new geopolitics of AI.

### 💰 Capital Concentration at the Top
The numbers tell a clear story: capital is concentrating around a handful of winners. OpenAI and Anthropic alone are raising tens of billions. This isn't a broad-based AI boom—it's a **platform consolidation**. The AI roll-up is accelerating.
