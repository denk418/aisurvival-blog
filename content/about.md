## Den Kim

**Head of Product at a proptech startup. Seoul-based.**

I started my career as a private equity analyst, evaluating technology businesses and their long-term value creation potential. That experience shaped how I think about structural shifts—the kind that create new winners and losers over decades, not quarters.

I later joined Samsung Electronics' semiconductor strategy team, where I led product strategy for multiple memory and foundry product lines. Working inside one of the world's largest semiconductor companies gave me a front-row seat to how AI, cloud, and edge computing reshape hardware demand—and which companies capture that value.

Today, I lead product at a Seoul-based living platform, building AI-powered experiences for residents and operations teams. I see daily how AI transforms real estate operations, tenant experiences, and the economics of property management.

### Why This Blog?

The AI era is creating both massive opportunities and existential risks. I created AI Survival to help investors and tech professionals navigate this transformation with:

- **Structural analysis**—not surface-level news
- **Data-driven insights**—backed by numbers, not narratives
- **Practical frameworks**—you can apply immediately
