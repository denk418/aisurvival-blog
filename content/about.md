## Den Kim

**Head of Product at a proptech startup. Seoul-based.**

I started my career as a private equity analyst, conducting research, business valuation, and financial modeling across energy, education, and lifestyle sectors. That experience taught me how to identify structural shifts that create long-term value—and how to separate signal from noise in rapidly changing markets.

I later joined Samsung Electronics' System LSI division, where I led product management for IoT and Digital TV SoCs. Working at the intersection of semiconductors and consumer electronics gave me insight into how AI, edge computing, and connectivity reshape hardware ecosystems—and which companies capture value at each layer.

Today, I lead product at a Seoul-based living platform, building AI-powered experiences for residents and operations teams. I see daily how AI transforms real estate operations, tenant experiences, and the economics of property management.

### Why This Blog?

The AI era is creating both massive opportunities and existential risks. I created AI Survival to help investors and tech professionals navigate this transformation with:

- **Structural analysis**—not surface-level news
- **Data-driven insights**—backed by numbers, not narratives
- **Practical frameworks**—you can apply immediately
